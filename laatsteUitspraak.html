                        <p>Michael Slager. He had no right to pull out his gun for an unarmed man who was running away from him and shoot him eight times. Emphasizing on the fact Walter Scott was unarmed. He posed no threat at all. Michael Slager deserves any punishment.</p>

                        <h2>Option 2</h2>
                        <p>Walter Scott. He shouldn't have resisted from the officer in the first place, let alone trying to grab his taser. No matter if Scott dropped the taser or not, he posed a threat towards officer Slager and therefore Slager was authorized to use deadly force.</p>

                        <h2>Option 3</h2>
                        <p>Neither. The answer isn't black or white. Yes, Michael Slager shot an unarmed man, but in his defence, he thought Scott took his taser. Slager felt threatened, but could've handled it better in this situation. You can't blame it one or the other.</p>

                                <p id="js--newspaper-article">Today, December 7, new information has been revealed about the incident with Walter Scott. U.S. District Judge David C. Norton sentenced officer Michael Slager with the death penalty for manslaughter. Although prosecutors had argued for voluntary manslaughter, the judge agreed with attorneys that the "inappropriate underlying offense" was aggravated first-degree murder. An appeal for reduction of sentence has been denied.</p>
